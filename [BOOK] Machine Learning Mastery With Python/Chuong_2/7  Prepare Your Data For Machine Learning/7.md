# üìä Chapter 7: Prepare Your Data For Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms often assume certain properties of your data. Preparing (preprocessing) your data is a crucial step to improve model performance. In this chapter, we explore common preprocessing techniques using scikit-learn.

## üß† 7.1 Why Data Preprocessing is Needed

- Most machine learning algorithms **expect data in a specific form**.
- Different algorithms **assume different distributions and scales**.
- Even though preprocessing often helps, sometimes **raw data** may perform better.
- The best approach: **try different transformations** and **evaluate multiple algorithms** on each version of your data.

## üîÅ 7.2 Types of Data Transforms

This chapter focuses on four preprocessing techniques using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**:

1. Rescale data (Min-Max normalization)
2. Standardize data (Gaussian normalization)
3. Normalize data (unit norm)
4. Binarize data (thresholding)

All techniques follow these steps:

- Load the dataset
- Split into input/output
- Apply a preprocessing transform
- Summarize the result

> scikit-learn provides two main approaches:
>
> - `fit()` + `transform()` ‚Äì Best for reuse (train/test consistency)
> - `fit_transform()` ‚Äì Convenient for one-time transformation

## üìè 7.3 Rescale Data

**Rescale features to a specific range**, commonly `[0, 1]`.

### ‚úÖ When to use:
- Algorithms using **distance calculations** (e.g., k-NN)
- Algorithms relying on **gradient descent** (e.g., neural networks)
- Regression-based models that **weigh features**

---

## üßÆ 7.4 Standardize Data

**Transform features to a standard Gaussian distribution**: mean = 0, standard deviation = 1.

### ‚úÖ When to use:
- Algorithms assuming **normal distribution** of input
- Works well with: 
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

> Note: Unlike rescaling, standardization **does not bound values** between 0 and 1.

---

## üìê 7.5 Normalize Data (Row-wise)

**Normalize each observation (row)** to unit length (L2 norm = 1).

### ‚úÖ When to use:
- Data is **sparse** (contains many zeros)
- Models that use:
  - Distance metrics (e.g., k-NN)
  - Weighted inputs (e.g., neural nets)

---

## üî≤ 7.6 Binarize Data (Thresholding)

**Convert data to binary values** using a threshold (e.g., > 0 becomes 1).

### ‚úÖ When to use:
- You want to **discretize numeric features**
- Useful in **feature engineering**
- Helpful when converting **probabilities to binary classes**

---

## ‚úÖ 7.7 Summary

In this chapter, you learned how to prepare your data for machine learning using **scikit-learn**. The key preprocessing techniques include:

- **Rescaling** to a fixed range
- **Standardizing** to Gaussian distribution
- **Normalizing** to unit norm
- **Binarizing** with thresholds
